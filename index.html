            <blockquote cite="https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/65453756">
                I call, therefore, on all players, fans, football officials, presidents, prime ministers, politicians and journalists all over the world to join us and support this call for a fair remuneration of women's football. Women deserve it, as simple as that.
